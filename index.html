The web should be a platform that helps people
and provides a positive social benefit.
As we continue to evolve the web platform,
we must therefore consider the consequences of our work.
The following document sets out ethical principles
that will drive the W3C's continuing work in this direction.

## Introduction {#intro}

The web should empower an equitable, informed and interconnected society.
It has been, and should continue to be, designed
to enable communication and knowledge-sharing for everyone.
In order for the web to continue to be beneficial to society,
we need to consider the ethical implications of our work
when we build web technologies, applications, and sites.

The web is made up of a number of technologies and technical standards.
HTML, CSS and JavaScript are often thought of as the web's core set of technologies
but there are many other technologies, standards,
languages and APIs that come together to form the "web platform."
We strive to maintain a strong ethical framework as a differentiator for the web platform,
for example an emphasis on
[internationalization](https://www.w3.org/International/),
[accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/),
[privacy](https://www.w3.org/Privacy/), and
[security](https://www.w3.org/Security/).
Web technologies are also released for use under a
[royalty free license](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/)
to enable open source implementation.
We build new web technologies in a collaborative manner
according to open processes
(for example, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/">W3C process</a>),
and in inclusive environments adhering to codes of conduct
(such as the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>).

These are often cited as some of the strengths of the web.
Despite this, in the 30 years since development of the web began,
it has become clear that the web platform can often be used in ways that subvert its original mission,
or even be used to cause harm.

The architecture of the web is designed with
the notion of different classes of application that retrieve and process content,
and represent the needs of the application's users.
This includes web browsers,
web-hosted applications such as search engines,
and software that acts on web resources.
This lends itself well towards empowering people
by allowing them to choose the browser, search engine, or other application
that best meets their needs
(for example, with strong privacy protections).

The web should also support human rights, dignity and personal agency.
We need to put internationally recognized human rights at the core of the web platform [[?UDHR]].
We can reinforce this approach by promoting ethical thinking across the web industry.

The principles in this document are deliberately unordered,
and many are interconnected with each other.
They are intended to be read together, rather than each in isolation, and to collectively support
a web that is beneficial for society.
When the effects of upholding one principle
may diminish the efficacy of another principle, the benefits and tradeoffs
need to be carefully balanced.
It is important to consider the context in which the technology
is being applied, the expected audience(s) for the technology,
who the technology benefits and who it may disadvantage,
and any power dynamics involved (see also the
<a data-cite="design-principles#priority-of-constituencies">priority of constituencies</a>).

### Purpose {#purpose}

This is a statement of the ethical principles of the W3C community.
Spec developers, authors and reviewers can use it to guide their thinking.
In particular, the purpose of this document is to
inform wide review of new charters,
new specifications, and
candidate additions to published recommendations.
For actionable guidance applicable to spec editors, site authors,
and others designing and building parts of the web platform,
see the [[[Design-Principles]]], [[[security-privacy-questionnaire]]],
the [[[Privacy-Principles]]], and [TAG Findings](https://tag.w3.org/findings/).

## Principles

<section>
  <h3 id="oneweb" data-export="" data-dfn-type="dfn">
There is one web
  </h3>
  <p>
When we are adding new web technologies and platforms,
we will build them to cross regional and national boundaries.
People in one location should be able to view web pages
from anywhere that is connected to the web.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 id="noharm" data-export="" data-dfn-type="dfn">
The web should not cause harm to society
  </h3>
  <p>
When we are adding a feature or technology to the web,
we will work to prevent or mitigate any harm it might cause society or groups,
especially to vulnerable people.
We consider a range of threat models that account for abuse scenarios
at different scales, from societal to interpersonal.
We will prioritize potential benefits for web users over potential benefits to web developers,
content providers, user agents, advertisers or others in the ecosystem,
in line with the
<a data-cite="design-principles#priority-of-constituencies">priority of constituencies</a>.
We commit to learning about and understanding diverse perspectives,
and will strive to reflect a respect for that diversity in the designs we produce,
so that our designs properly respect the interests and views of
all of the people who might be affected by them.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 id="community" data-export="" data-dfn-type="dfn">
The web must support healthy community and debate
  </h3>
  <p>
We are building technologies and platforms for distributing ideas,
for virtual interaction,
and for mass collaboration on any topic.
While those tools can be used for good,
they can also be used for spreading misinformation,
revealing private personal information (doxing),
harassment, and persecution.
We will consider these risks in the work we do,
and will build web technologies and platforms
that respect individuals' rights
and provide features to empower them against dangers like these.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 id="allpeople" data-export="" data-dfn-type="dfn">
The web is for all people
  </h3>
  <p>
People should not need a high level of technical literacy to use the web.
Web platform technologies should behave consistently and intuitively.
We will build internationalization and localization capabilities
into our specifications and websites.
We will accommodate people on low bandwidth networks and with low specification equipment.
The web platform and the tools we use to create it
must be accessible to people with disabilities,
including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities.
Anyone should be able to meaningfully participate
in the creation of specifications, user agents, and content,
and the platform should enable a fully accessible end user experience.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 id="privacy" data-export="" data-dfn-type="dfn">
The web must be secure, and respect peoples' privacy
  </h3>
  <p>
When we add features to the web platform,
we are making decisions that impact peoples'
ability to control their personal data.
This data includes their conversations,
their financial transactions
and how they live their lives.
We will start by creating web technologies
that create as few risks as possible,
and will make sure people understand
what risks they are taking when they use the web.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 id="expression" data-export="" data-dfn-type="dfn">
The web must enable freedom of expression
  </h3>
  <p>
We will create web technologies and platforms
that encourage free expression,
where that does not contravene other human rights.
Our work should not enable state censorship, <a data-cite="RFC7258#section-1">surveillance</a>
or other practices that seek to limit this freedom.
This principle must be balanced with respect for other human rights,
and does not imply that individual services on the web must therefore support all speech.
(For example: hate speech, harassment or abuse may reasonably be denied a platform).
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 id="verify" data-export="" data-dfn-type="dfn">
The web must make it possible for people to verify information and assess the trustworthiness of its source.
  </h3>
  <p>
Society relies on the integrity of public information.
We have a responsibility to build web technologies to counter misinformation, 
and to maintain the integrity of information for public good.
The public needs verifiable source and context information to recognize
trustworthy web publishers and content.
The concept of origin and 
<a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/distributed-content/">its relationship with information sources</a> 
are core to the web's security model.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 id="control" data-export="" data-dfn-type="dfn">
The web must enhance individuals' control and power
  </h3>
  <p>
We recognize that web technologies can be used
to manipulate and deceive people, complicate isolation, and encourage addictive behaviors.
We seek to mitigate against these potential abuses
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern">patterns</a>
when creating new technologies and platforms,
and avoid introducing technologies that increase the chance of
people being harmed in this way.
We aim to reduce centralization in web architecture,
minimizing single points of failure and single points of control.
We will also build web technologies for individual developers
as well for developers at large companies and organizations.
The web should enable do-it-yourself developers.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 id="sustainable" data-export="" data-dfn-type="dfn">
The web must be an environmentally sustainable platform
  </h3>
  <p>
Web technologies may have overall positive environmental impacts
as well as negative impacts,
and these can change over time and vary geographically as 
both web and environmental technologies develop.
We will endeavor not to do further harm to the environment
when we introduce new technologies to the web, and keep in mind
that people most affected by the environmental consequences of new technologies
may not be those who benefit from the features introduced.
This includes, but is not limited to,
lowering carbon emissions by minimizing data storage and processing requirements, as well as reducing electronic waste by
maximizing the lifespan of physical devices through backwards compatibility.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 id="transparent" data-export="" data-dfn-type="dfn">
The web is transparent
  </h3>
  <p>
The web was built on a "view source" principle,
currently realized through robust developer tools built into many browsers.
We will always make sure it is possible
to determine how a web application was built
and how the code works.
Furthermore, we will always make sure it is possible
to audit and inspect web applications and underlying software
for security, privacy or other considerations.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 id="multi" data-export="" data-dfn-type="dfn">
The web is multi-browser, multi-OS and multi-device
  </h3>
  <p>
We will not create web technologies that encourage the creation of websites
that work only in one browser,
or only on particular hardware.
We expect that content provided by accessing a URL
<a data-cite="mobile-bp#tc">should yield a thematically consistent experience</a>
when someone is accessing it from different devices.
The existence of multiple interoperable implementations
enables competition, and thus a variety of choices
for web users.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3 id="render" data-export="" data-dfn-type="dfn">
People should be able to render web content as they want
  </h3>
  <p>
People must be able to change web pages according to their needs.
For example, people should be able to install style sheets,
assistive browser extensions,
and blockers of unwanted content or scripts or auto-played videos.
We will build features and write specifications
that respect peoples' agency,
and will create user agents to represent those preferences on the web user's behalf.
