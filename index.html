## Introduction {#intro}

The web should empower an equitable, informed and interconnected society.
It has been, and should continue to be designed
to enable communication and knowledge-sharing for everyone.
In the 30 years since development of the web began,
it has become clear that the web platform can often be used in ways that subvert that mission.
Furthermore, web technologies can be used to cause harm,
which is not in keeping with the spirit of this social mission.
The web should be a platform that helps people
and provides a net positive social benefit.
As we continue to evolve the web platform,
we must therefore consider the ethical implications of our work.
The web must be for good.

In order for the web to continue to be beneficial to society,
we need to include more ethical thinking when we build
web technologies, applications and sites.
The web is made up of a number of technologies and technical standards.
HTML, CSS and JavaScript are often thought of as the web's core set of technologies
but there are a raft of other technologies, standards, languages and APIs that come together to form the "web platform."
One of the web platform's differentiators has always been a strong ethical framework;
for example an emphasis on
[internationalization](https://www.w3.org/International/)
[accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/)
[privacy](https://www.w3.org/Privacy/)
[security](https://www.w3.org/Security/)


Web technologies are also offered
[royalty free](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/)
to enable open source implementation,
arguably an ethical choice that has been a factor in its success as a platform.
These are often cited as some of the strengths of the web.

The architecture of the web is designed with
the important notion of different classes of application that retrieve and process content,
and represent the needs of its users.
This includes web browsers,
web-hosted applications such as search engines,
and software that acts on web resources.
This lends itself well towards this more ethical approach
by allowing the person using the web to choose
a browser, search engine or other application
that best meets their needs
(for example, with strong privacy protections).

The web should also support human rights, dignity and personal agency.
We need to put internationally recognized human rights at the core of the web platform.
And we need to promote ethical thinking across the web industry
to reinforce this approach.

The purpose of this document is
to inform TAG review of new specifications
and to inform other documents such as the
[[[Design-Principles]]], [[[security-privacy-questionnaire]]]
or other similar checklists and sets of principles used by specification authors and editors.
It also serves to raise awareness of the ethical responsibilities of web makers.


## Principles

<dl>
<dt><dfn id="oneweb" data-export="">
  There is one web
</dfn></dt>
<dd>
When we are adding new web technologies and platforms,
we will build them to cross regional and national boundaries.
People in one location should be able to view web pages
from anywhere that is connected to the web.
</dd>

<dt><dfn id="noharm" data-export="">
  The web should not cause harm to society
</dfn></dt>
<dd>
When we are adding a feature or technology to the web,
we will consider what harm it could do to society or groups,
especially vulnerable people.
We will prioritize potential benefits for end users over potential benefits to web developers,
content providers, user agents, advertisers or others in the ecosystem,
in line with the
<a data-cite="design-principles#priority-of-constituencies">priority of constituencies</a>.
We will build new web technologies in a collaborative matter
according to open processes
(for example, the [W3C process](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/)
Furthermore, by adhering to codes of conduct
(such as the W3C [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/))
we will ensure the requirements and views of marginalized communities are respected.
</dd>

<dt><dfn id="community" data-export="">
  The web must support healthy community and debate
</dfn></dt>
<dd>
We are building technologies and platforms for distributing ideas,
for virtual interaction,
and for mass collaboration on any topic.
While those tools can be used for good,
they can also be used for spreading misinformation,
virtual and offline harassment,
and building communities for doxxing and persecution.
We will consider these risks in the work we do,
and will build web technologies and platforms
that respect individuals' rights
and provide features to empower them against dangers like these.
</dd>

<dt><dfn id="allpeople" data-export="">
  The web is for all people
</dfn></dt>
<dd>
We will build internationalization and localization capabilities
into our specs and websites.
The web platform and the tools we use to create it
must be accessible to people with disabilities.
We all should be able to meaningfully participate
in the creation of specs, user agents and content,
and the platform should enable a fully accessible end user experience.
Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities,
including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities.
We must build for users on low bandwidth networks and low specification equipment.
</dd>

<dt><dfn id="privacy" data-export="">
  Security and privacy are essential
</dfn></dt>
<dd>
We will write specs and build platforms in line with our responsibility to our users,
knowing that we are making decisions
that change their ability to protect their personal data.
This data includes their conversations,
their financial transactions
and how they live their lives.
We will start by creating web technologies
that create as few risks as possible,
and will make sure our users understand
what they are risking in using our services.
</dd>

<dt><dfn id="expression" data-export="">
  The web must enable freedom of expression
</dfn></dt>
<dd>
We will create web technologies and platforms
that encourage free expression,
where that does not contravene other human rights.
Our work should not enable state censorship, <a data-cite="RFC7258#section-1">surveillance</a>
or other practices that seek to limit this freedom.
This principle must be balanced with respect for other human rights,
and does not imply that individual services on the web must therefore support all speech.
(For example: hate speech, harassment or abuse may reasonably be denied a platform).
</dd>

<dt><dfn id="verify" data-export="">
  The web must make it possible for people to verify the information they see
</dfn></dt>
<dd>
We have a responsibility to build web technologies to counter misinformation,
allowing information sources to be traceable and facts to be checkable.
The concept of origin and source is core to the web's security model.
We will make sure the new web technologies we create
do not work against this architectural principle.
</dd>

<dt><dfn id="control" data-export="">
  The web must enhance individuals' control and power
</dfn></dt>
<dd>
We recognize that web technologies can be used by developers
to manipulate people, complicate isolation and encourage addictive behaviors.
We recognize these risks
and seek to mitigate against them
when creating these technologies and platforms.
We will therefore favor a decentralized web architecture
that minimizes single points of failure and single points of control.
We will also build Web technologies for individual developers
as well for developers at large companies and organizations.
The web should enable do-it-yourself developers.
</dd>

<dt><dfn id="sustainable" data-export="">
  The web must be an environmentally sustainable platform
</dfn></dt>
<dd>
The web, as a whole, is a big source of carbon emissions, because it is a big consumer of power.
New web technologies should not make this situation worse.
We will consider power consumption and the resulting emissions
when we introduce new technologies to the web.
</dd>

<dt><dfn id="transparent" data-export="">
  The web is transparent
</dfn></dt>
<dd>
The web was built on a "view source" principle,
currently realized through robust developer tools built into many browsers.
We will always make sure it is possible
to determine how a web application was built
and how the code works.
Furthermore, we will always make sure it is possible
to audit and inspect web applications and underlying software
for security, privacy or other considerations.
</dd>

<dt><dfn id="multi" data-export="">
  The web is multi-browser, multi-OS and multi-device
</dfn></dt>
<dd>
We will not create web technologies that encourage the creation of websites that work only in one browser.
We expect that content provided by accessing a URL
<a data-cite="mobile-bp#tc">should yield a thematically consistent experience</a>
when the user is accessing it from different devices.
The constant competition and variety of choices for our users
that come from having multiple interoperable implementations
means the web ecosystem is constantly improving.
</dd>

<dt><dfn id="render" data-export="">
  People should be able to render web content as they want
</dfn></dt>
<dd>
For example, users should be able to install style sheets,
assistive browser extensions,
and blockers of unwanted content or scripts or auto-played videos.
Through technologies such as browser extensions,
people must continue to be able to change web pages according to their needs.
We will build platforms and write specs
that respect the user's authority,
and will create user agents to represent those preferences on the user's behalf.
</dd>
